This is an iOS demo application for calculating tip amounts.

Time spent: 1.5 hours spent on core functionality

Completed user stories:

<p>Required: User can enter bill amount</p>
<p>Required: User can select between three tip amounts</p>
<p>Required: User can see tip and total bill amounts</p>

Notes:
Spent some time adding placeholder text to the bill amount. Also added images for the app icon, launch, and background screens.
